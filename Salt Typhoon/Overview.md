Observations and conclusions on Salt Typhoon will be compiled here

Target: Government entities and related telecom providers
Goal: Unclear as of now, but seems to be intent on exfiltrating national secrets

Initial access: compromise of network devices. In one instance, Cisco reports finding CVE-2018-0171 was abused; however in other instances the victim credentials were obtained illegitimately (https://blog.talosintelligence.com/salt-typhoon-analysis/). Though the blog does not mention specifics, it is safe to assume this is some form of social engineering (i.e. phishing), default credentials, or potentially an insecure repository of username/password information.
